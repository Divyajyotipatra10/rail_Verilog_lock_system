We have brought a Memory based Rail lock storage system which will take input from the user at the time of boarding and User can change the password through out the journey.
There will be a 'RESET' button in each coach which can be accessed only by the coach attendent and if someone try to breach the password by applying wrong inputs a message
will be sent to the user's phone. User will have maximum 3 chances to unlock after attempting a single wrong attempt.
